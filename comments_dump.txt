1:46 This exact vocal melody when he sings "a native tounge will hold you" especially the pronunciation of "will hold you" is so familiar to me... I think I've heard it in some song a long time ago that I can't put my finger on, but this part instantly reminded of an old song..

I'm really loving this whole "space grunge" thing that's bubbling back up. It's strangely familiar and refreshing. If anyone else feels similar, check out Cosmonauts by Quicksand. It's pretty awesome too.

Can't believe it. Been listening to Magnetic North on repeat past few days. Then I decided to look them up again to see if there was any word about getting back together and putting out a new album. To my surprise, not only are they back together, they're also releasing an album less than a month from now!!! Don't you love it when things like this happen? Anyways, love this band. And this song is just absolutely fantastic. Will for sure be a killer album!! üëçüíôüëçüíúüëç

This is epic guys. Simply epic. I'm 38, been listening since frailty of words and this sirs is right up there with no wings to speak of. All the comebacks from other bands of the same era can't even come close to this. Hats off. Hats off.

First of all: SO thankful that this is finally happening. Secondly: Who is that actress at 3:40?! She is so familiar and I cannot for the life of me place her.

I was a huge fan of these guys in high school they always made me have a drive in life to keep going and working hard. When they spilt it was very heart breaking but with a return like this and being so powerful and beautiful it makes me want to drive on harder in my adult life.

Was listening to this in an alt-rock spotify playlist. I thought: "Damn, someone rips off hopesfall..." Then I checked the title "WTF, THEY'RE BACK!"

“It just nice to win one.” If that wasn’t an Office reference to Kevin, it was a heck of a coincidence lol but either way, it hit me in the feels

10:23... That happened to me on a one tap off-the-wall shot at 0:00 in a tournament that didn't count. Then my team & I  proceed to lose in OT.

The amount of hurt is intolerable.

"You guys struggling in raked?" I struggle everywhere. Ranked, unranked, bot matches, extra modes, training mode.

So, yes, I'm struggling in ranked :P

My friend told me this, don’t be scared of competitive. “Don’t be scared about deranking, either you win or lose. You are one step closer to gc.” I believe in you guys to get to gc, if you haven’t already, it’s fine if you lose. You learn from your mistakes, there is nothing bad about that.
